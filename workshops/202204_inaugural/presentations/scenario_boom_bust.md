### Introduction


* Yesterday's simulation illustrated costs of macroprudential policy under different scenarios
* We now illustrate benefits and role for active macroprudential policy in smoothing boom-and-bust cycles 


---

### Boom phase

* **Increase in asset prices** stemming from (overly) optimistic expectations of future 
	* Asset prices in the model depend on discounted future expected GDP streams
	* But we can also boost asset prices without boosting GDP expectations
* **Economy booms**, wealth effects, consumption and investment increase
	* Credit-to-GDP ratio increases, lending conditions are loose
* **Financial system metrics improve**
	* Credit risk is seemingly low, underestimated
	* Portfolio default rates decrease
	* Bank profits increase

### Bust phase
* (Overly optimistic) expectations suddenly revised down
* Asset prices quickly drop
* **Economic activity drops** (wealth effects, balance sheets with excessive debt), credit performance worsens
* Financial system metrics quickly deteriorate
	* Portfolio default rates increase
	* Bank capital positions worsen
	* Previously hidden risks materialize, banks need to quickly provision against new, higher levels of credit risk
* Banks react by tightening lending conditions
* Financial system **deepens** the economic downturn

### Role of macroprudential policy

* **Build-up of capital buffers** during the boom phase
	* Brinds somewhat tighter lending conditions
	* But costs in terms of lost output are limited, economy operates above equilibrium anyway
* **Release of buffers** in bust phase
	* Improves bank capital position relative to effective regulatory minimum
	* Supports credit creation and growth	
* The policy smoothes financial cycle, resulting in smoother business cycle
	* Benefits far outweigh the costs incurred in the boom phase
* The role of **nonlinearities** is again crucial

### Challenges in practice

* Uncertainty about position within the financial cycle
* The model cannot reliably identify "excess" credit growth, position within the financial cycle
* Position within the cycle is one of the model inputs
* The model helps to build **what-if scenarios**, useful for policymakers to evaluate their policy options
