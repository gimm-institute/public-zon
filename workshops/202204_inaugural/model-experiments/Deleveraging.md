# Simple deleveraging experiment

---

### Deleveraging is costly

* A smell test for fin stab and macropru models–the same way a "costly disinflation" exercise in monetary policy

* Deleveraging is costly because of __stock-flow__ relationships: distinction between the stock of outstanding credit and the flow of new credit

* Stock of loans can be brought down only be "cumulating" large enough reductions in new credit

* New credit is, in turn, linked to real economic activity

* Explore the __nonlinearities__ depending on the size of disturbances

### Very basic simulation 

* A small open economy accumulated an excessive level of bank credit ("excessive": in practice, always highly judgmental)

* At some point, a sudden reversal in perceptions and/or fundamentals occurs, forcing the economy to deleverage as measured by the bank credit to GDP ratio

* Simulate three versions of the scenario, depending on the size of revisions
